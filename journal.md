# Project Journal - [11/06/2024]

## Daily Log
- Learning about docker compose
    - trying to setup development environment via container
        - getting comfortable on docker
- Setup Github repositories
    - adding bunch of stuff that makes it more clean and structurable
    - trying to make a project that easy to understand (*docs)
    - giving links for reference


## Thoughts and Decisions
- Making journal and documentation for progress and guidence
- setup development environment via container because i thought it will be easier and not conflicting in the local


## Problems and Solutions

### Dockers
1. Docker Compose
- **Problem**: trying to make development enviroment for project
  **Solution**: turns out it's better to be development on local then build in on container and i don't know how when production later (make 2 compose?)

- **Problem**: usually problem arise from permission and folder when building container
  **Solution**: don't forget for to use ROOT and read the errors, be patient and slowly learn the error

## Ideas and Improvements
- Patient
- see linux guide on permission and how docker behaves
