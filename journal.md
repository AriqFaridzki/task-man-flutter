# Project Journal - [11/06/2024]

## Daily Log
- Learn about docker compose
    - trying to setup development environment via container
        - getting comfortable on docker
- Setup Github repositories
    - adding bunch of stuff that makes it more clean and structurable
    - trying to make a project that easy to understand (*docs)
    - giving links for reference


## Thoughts and Decisions
- Making journal and documentation for progress and guidence
- setup development environment via container because i thought it will be easier and not conflicting in the local


## Problems and Solutions

### Dockers
1. Docker Compose
- **Problem**: trying to make development enviroment for project
- **Solution**: turns out it's better to be development on local then build in on container and i don't know how when production later (make 2 compose?)

- **Problem**: usually problem arise from permission and folder when building container
- **Solution**: don't forget for to use ROOT and read the errors, be patient and slowly learn the error

## Ideas and Improvements
- Patient
- see linux guide on permission and how docker behaves

# Project Journal - [12/06/2024]

## Daily Log
- Learn About Flutter
    - getting used using flutter, 
        - things like widgets, scaffold, body, title, text, row, column
- Fix Environment For Flutter Development
    - install visual studio dev kit for desktop ( so it can emulate on windows)
- Design UI on figma
    - just a little bit on the home screen


## Thoughts and Decisions
- first thing when i learn flutter is pure confusion, so i need to be slow and patient
- why not use the web browser for debugging? because it doesn't support hot reload ( only hot restart)
- by designing the UI, i can picture where is the data will go later


## Problems and Solutions

### Dockers
1. Flutter
- **Problem**:  lack understanding of basic fundamental on flutter 
- **Solution**: learn about the widget, stateless or stateful, scaffold, overall structure of flutter, characteristic and sometimes just look at the code on bigger picture

2. Visual studio dev kit for desktop
- **Problem**: error occured when installing visual studio dev kit (Microsoft.VisualCpp.Redist.14,version=14.38.33130,chip=x64' failed to install)
- **Solution**: just install the thing manually ( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170 )

3. UI design
- **Problem**:  lack understanding about UI placement and overall layout
- **Solution**: just learn a bit on other people project

## Ideas and Improvements
- i dont have atm
- patient and trust the process
